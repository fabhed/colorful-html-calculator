To create an HTML calculator with a cool color scheme, we will need to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

HTML will be used to create the structure of the calculator, CSS will be used to style the calculator and give it a cool color scheme, and JavaScript will be used to make the calculator functional.

Here are the core files and their purposes:

1. `index.html`: This is the main HTML file that will contain the structure of the calculator.
2. `styles.css`: This is the CSS file that will contain the styles for the calculator.
3. `script.js`: This is the JavaScript file that will contain the logic for the calculator.

Let's start with the `index.html` file:
